  Program keeps score of number of wins across multiple games
  Player may choose the number of decks to allow for card counting

  Multiple players (uncertian about the need to add this, would be a "final update" idea)

Progress
  Jan 12 - Project begins, basic structures and mechanics implemented, debugging necessary
  Jan 13 - Discovered much more debugging was necessary, likely made the game worse (oops)
  Jan 16 - More debugging ): , github initialized for backup purposes

Projected Timeline

  Jan 26 - Fourth mission statement complete
  Late Jan - Fifth mission statement complete
  ??? - Sixth mission statement complete (uncertian if this update will actually be added)

*I know these timeline dates are very spread out for a project worth like a single day of work, but its my project so I make the rules*
