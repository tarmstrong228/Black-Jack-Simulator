# Black-Jack-Simulator

*WORK IN PROGRESS/NOT COMPLETE - LAST UPDATED 1/16/25*

Mission<br />
  A one-player black jack simulator against a bot that cannot hit after a score of 17<br />
  Player has the choice to hit or not<br />
  Program keeps score of number of wins across multiple games<br />
  Player may choose the number of decks to allow for card counting<br />
  Play can split their hand  (wayy wayy later update)<br />
  Multiple players (uncertian about the need to add this, would be a "final update" idea)<br />

Progress<br />
  Jan 12 - Project begins, basic structures and mechanics implemented, debugging necessary<br />
  Jan 13 - Discovered much more debugging was necessary, likely made the game worse (oops)<br />
  Jan 16 - More debugging :( , github initialized for backup purposes<br />

Projected Timeline<br />
  Jan 19 - First three mission statements completed<br />
  Jan 26 - Fourth mission statement complete<br />
  Late Jan - Fifth mission statement complete<br />
  ??? - Sixth mission statement complete (uncertian if this update will actually be added)<br />

*I know these timeline dates are very spread out for a project worth like a single day of work, but its my project so I make the rules*<br />
